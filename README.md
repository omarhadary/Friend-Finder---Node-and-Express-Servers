# Friend-Finder


This is an Amazon-like storefront which takes orders from customers and depletes stock in the store's inventory.

A database is created to store the inventory and includes 10 different products with columns to store:
  - Product unique ID
  - Product name
  - Department name
  - Product Price
  - Count of quantity left in stock 

> All user experience is through the terminal and updated to the local database.
